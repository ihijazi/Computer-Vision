# Computer-Vision

In this repo, you will find some of computer vision techniques applied from scratch using Python.

I rely mainly on Numpy and matrix operations (rather than for loops), hence the performance is phenominal.

So far I got:
1. Basic image operations such as nagative, flipping, swapping channels, averging and adding random value
2. Equalization
3. Color space conversion from RGB to YUV
4. Gaussian filter
5. Bilateral filter
6. Harris Corner Detector
7. K-Means, K-Means++
8. Color Image Segmentation
9. Eigenfaces & Face Detection
